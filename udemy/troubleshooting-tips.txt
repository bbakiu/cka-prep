1. Don't forget to check the pods in kube-system
2. To check the kubeconfig file run
 `kubectl cluster-info --kubeconfig=file-path`
3. Check fo typos in kube-controller-manager
4. kubelet and proxy should be running in worker node
5. etcd, proxy, scheduler, api-server, controller manager, CNI should be running in master/controlplane
6. by default static pod path = /etc/kubernetes/manifests. create it if it does not exit
   Or check ps -ef | grep -i kubelet and find --config param
7. Check names,labels and ports of pod, service and ingress. Make sure they match.
8. Check NetworkPolicies
9. Check the ports and labels
10. Check endpoints of the service and make sure the selector of service matches label of pod
11. Check env variable that they are correct in pod/deployment
12. network between pods and services
13. Check port of service/endpoint of ingress to make sure they are correct
14. Bookmark link to install network plugin
15. check scheduler status
16. check logs of static pods in kube-system
17. learn to user journalctl
18. kubelet config file by default: /var/lib/kubelet/config
19. kubeadm config /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.de/10-kubeadm.conf
20. kubecontroller-manager - responsible for deploy/scale
21. for certificates make sure th volume and volume mount are matching the path
22. check if kubelet is running and start it if not
23. kubectl describe node node01 - to check node logs 
24. journalctl to troubleshoot further in the node
    `journalctl -u kubelet` `journalctl -u kube-proxy`
25. kubectl cluster-info -- where api server is running
26. check kube config from /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
27. If you run systemctl status kubelet you know where config of kubelet is store
    2 are the most imporant part: 
     - --kubeconfig -> api server comm -- server section 6443!
     - --config for kubelet config stuff.
